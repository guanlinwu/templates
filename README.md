## Documentation

- [For this template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This will scaffold the project using the `master` branch. If you wish to use the latest version of the webpack template, do the following instead:

``` bash
$ vue init guanlinwu/templates my-project
```

:warning: **The develop branch is not considered stable and can contain bugs or not build at all, so use at your own risk.**

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.


### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

``` bash
vue init username/repo my-project
```
